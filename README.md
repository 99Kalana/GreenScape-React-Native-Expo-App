# GreenScape: Your Personal Plant Care Companion ü™¥

GreenScape is a cross-platform mobile application designed for single-user plant enthusiasts to manage their personal plant collection.  
This app serves as a digital plant tracker, providing a centralized place to **add, view, update, and delete** plant records.  
It also helps users remember key care tasks by setting reminders for watering and fertilizing.

This project was developed as the final coursework for the **ITS 2127 - Advanced Mobile Developer** module.  
It demonstrates core mobile development competencies, including:

- **Data Persistence & Authentication**: User and plant data are securely stored in a Firebase database, accessible only after successful user authentication.
- **Core Functionality (CRUD)**: Implements full **Create, Read, Update, Delete** operations for plant data.
- **API Integration**: Integrates with a third-party plant identification API (e.g., PlantNet) to identify plants from photos.
- **Navigation**: A responsive navigation system for smooth screen transitions.
- **State Management**: Global state management ensures a seamless user experience.
