GreenScape: Your Personal Plant Care Companion ðŸª´
GreenScape is a cross-platform mobile application designed for single-user plant enthusiasts to manage their personal plant collection. This app serves as a digital plant tracker, providing a centralized place to add, view, update, and delete plant records. It also helps users remember key care tasks by setting reminders for watering and fertilizing.

API Integration: The app integrates with a third-party plant identification API (e.g., PlantNet) to allow users to identify plants from a photo.


Navigation: The app includes a responsive navigation system to move between screens.


State Management: Global state management is handled to ensure a smooth user experience.
